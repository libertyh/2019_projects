### Volume to HCP CIFTI
**Project url(s)**: [Volume to HCP surface](https://github.com/htwangtw/hcp-surface-format), 
[GIFTI API proposal](https://github.com/nipy/nibabel/issues/789)\
**Contributors**: [Hao-Ting Wang (HCP, visualisation, GIFTI)](https://github.com/htwangtw), 
[Gia H Ngo (HCP, visualisation)](https://github.com/ngohgia), 
[Chris Markiewicz (GIFTI)](https://github.com/effigies)\
**Description of project**: We want to put our preprocessed volume space data on to the HCP surface template. The goal is to have the whole workflow in Python. Due to the lack of high-level surface-based tools, we are also looking into solutions to GIFTI/CIFTI file IO and visualisation. The future goal is to provide more user-friendly tools to work with surface data in Python!\
**How to get involved**: You discuss the new GIFTI API under issues or help Gia withe the python workflow. 

### Neuropythy for Dev

**Description of project**: Use [neuropythy](https://github.com/noahbenson/neuropythy) to visualize developmental changes in brain structure in participants from the [HCP Lifespan Pilot Study.](https://www.humanconnectome.org/lifespan-studies)\
**Goals**: 1) Access and download HCP Lifespan Pilot Data, 2) Run HCP preprocessing pipelines using a docker container on AWS, 3) Use neuropythy to retrieve and visualize age-related differences in structural properties like cortical thickness.\
**How to get involved**: Suggestions for other types of structural analysis (gyrification, TI/T2 differences) and functional analysis (resting state, tasks) are welcome. We look forward to analyzing the HCP-D and HCP-A datasets in the near future!

  [Sam Nastase](https://github.com/snastase), [Adina Wagner](https://github.com/adswa)\
**Description of project**: How accurate and variable are annotations provided by various tools
  for automated feature extractions?
  We try to use available interfaces in [pliers](https://github.com/tyarkoni/pliers) for face and speech annotation
  on the movie Forrest Gump, and aim to evaluate their results accuracy and variance.\
